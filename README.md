#GtR Native

A brief demo of the Native API from [Gateway-to-Research](http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/), to explore the data format and the quantity and quality of the data.  You can start it with:

    python web.py
    
It reads from the GtR API in real time, and does not cache.  There is no attempt to make this look nice, it's just an experiment.  Make of it what you will.
